Our  APis  are coded as a part of who accepts the  request?  ( controller)
If  you are Following  the  **REST** standards  your api should be  Designed   around  the  **entities/resources** that it is  effecting 
For example  when we are going  to create the  product or delete the  product  all of these are affecting Product  entity 
they belong to Product controller

lly we have  getallcategory it belongs to category controller
